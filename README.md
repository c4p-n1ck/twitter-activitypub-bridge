# Twitter ActivityPub Bridge
Convert twitter users and tweets to ActivityPub format.  

English | [Japanese (日本語)](https://github.com/hideki0403/twitter-activitypub-bridge/blob/master/README_JA.md)

## Features
### Follow twitter user from Fediverse(*)
You can follow users who have not moved from Twitter to the Fediverse, such as Mastodon.  
By following a user, tweets on the Twitter side can be viewed as toots (notes) from Fediverse instances such as Mastodon.  
  
(*) Fediverse (ActivityPub compatible software): Mastodon, Misskey, Pixelfed, etc.  

## Notice
This software is only for **temporarily** following users who have not moved (or seem unable to move) to Fediverse.  
Specific usage is intended to follow official accounts for games, anime, etc.  
Fediverse and Twitter have very different cultures, and there is no intention to make Fediverse more like Twitter with this software.  
(If you would rather come to Fediverse and follow only general (not official) users on Twitter, you should use Twitter instead of Fediverse.)
